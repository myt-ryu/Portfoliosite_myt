# Project Rules

## Deployment Workflow
- **CRITICAL**: Always verify changes on the local development server (typically `npm run dev`) before pushing to the `main` branch.
- After local verification, provide the user with the local URL to confirm.
- Only proceed to deployment (push to `main`) after receiving explicit user approval based on the local verification.

## Communication
- Always respond in Japanese (Memory: user_global).
